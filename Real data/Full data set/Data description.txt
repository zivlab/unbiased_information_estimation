General description:
--------------------
The calcium imaging data set consists of n=9 mice. N=4 mice were imaged in hippocampal CA1 and N=5 mice imaged in hippocampal CA3.
For each mouse the data includes the last for imaging sessions in each of two different linear tracks (straight and L-shape), when the environments are already familiar.
The data includes the estimated spike trains (based on the CNMF-e algorithm) and the binned mouse position for the running periods of each 20-minute-long session.
The time bin of the spike train and stimulus trace is the same as the imaging frame rate (20Hz in all mice except for C8M2 which was imaged at 10Hz).


Data organization:
------------------
<mouseID>_spike_train:
A cell of size 2x4x2, corresponding to 2 environments, 4 sessions per environments, 2 running directions per environment 
<mouseID>_stimulus_trace:
A cell of size 2x4x2, corresponding to 2 environments, 4 sessions per environments, 2 running directions per environment
